We expose a: 


and then within an experiment there are epochs


which has /experiments


then under an experiment: 

experiment/
    .recordepoch()
    epochs/
         epoch1
         epoch2
...


an experiment can be in "recording" mode, which is a closely-coupled

experiment.pause()

then you will be unable to edit any of the "dataset" properties of that
epoch
