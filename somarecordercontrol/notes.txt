Each gui element has an associated data element

How do we handle the creation of a new epoch? 

Each experiment has:
   /info : experiment info  
      /default: default settings, masks, etc. 
      /notes
      / configuration and setup data
   /run0
   /run1 
   /sleep0
   /sleep1


What are the things we need to keep in sync? 

native (remote) experiment and epoch objects
local treeview for experiments, epochs
local property sheets for experiments, epochs

REMEMBER "OPEN EXPERIMENTS" is a REMOTE PROPERTY TOO

One option: the gui only reflects the remote data. 

Data set interface: 

GetDataSets()
Returns tuples: 
 [ (0, [0, 2, 3], Name), 
   (1, [1, 2], Name) ]

SetDataState()
